# Options-Trading-Stocks
Webscraping program for finding undervalued call options.

During times of margin calls, or in low traded stocks, people will often put their call options for sale at a price lower than it could be executed for, and the stock sold. This is because many people do not have the money to execute options.

This program searches the NASDAQ and identifies these stocks, notifying me of them, so I have a chance to buy them.
